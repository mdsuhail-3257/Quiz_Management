# Ramadan Quiz Automation

## Overview
The **Ramadan Quiz Automation** project is designed to streamline the process of conducting a daily quiz throughout the month of Ramadan. The goal is to help participants, including students, housewives, and working professionals, build a stronger relationship with Allah and the Holy Quran by automating quiz distribution, response collection, result generation, and participant tracking.

## Features
- **Automated Quiz Distribution**: Sends quiz form links to registered participants daily.
- **Response Collection & Evaluation**: Retrieves and evaluates quiz responses.
- **Result Generation & Email Notification**: Calculates scores and emails results to participants.
- **Absentee Tracking**: Marks participants as absent if they fail to submit responses and notifies them.
- **Performance Tracking**: Maintains a record of daily quiz performance for each participant.
- **Merit List Generation**: Compiles a final performance report at the end of the month.

## Project Workflow
### **1. Initial Setup**
- The admin adds participants' names and emails to the **Quiz_Registrations** sheet.
- The daily quiz questions and answers are updated in the **Daily_Quizzes** sheet.
- The Google Form is linked to the quiz for participants to submit responses.

### **2. Daily Quiz Distribution**
- The script extracts quiz questions from the **Daily_Quizzes** sheet.
- Updates the Google Form with the new quiz.
- Sends quiz form links via email to all registered participants.

### **3. Response Collection & Evaluation**
- The script fetches quiz responses submitted via Google Forms.
- Matches selected answers with the correct answers stored in **Quiz_History**.
- Calculates scores and updates the **Quiz_Results** sheet.

### **4. Absentee Marking**
- Compares the list of registered participants with the submitted responses.
- Marks missing participants as absent and sends them a notification email.

### **5. Results Notification**
- Participants receive an email with their quiz scores and status (Passed/Failed).
- Results are stored in the **Quiz_Results** sheet.

### **6. Monthly Merit List Generation**
- Tracks the performance of each participant over the course of one month.
- Generates a merit list based on overall quiz scores.

## How to Run the Script
### **1. Set Up Google Apps Script**
- Open Google Sheets ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Apps Script.
- Copy the script files into the Apps Script Editor.
- Update the Google Form ID inside the script.
- Deploy necessary triggers:
  - **updateDailyQuiz()** (Runs once a day to send the quiz form link)
  - **recordQuizResults()** (Runs periodically to fetch responses and update results)
  - **sendDailyResults()** (Runs after results are updated to send emails)

### **2. Run Functions Manually (For Debugging)**
- `updateDailyQuiz()` ‚Üí Sends the quiz form link.
- `recordQuizResults()` ‚Üí Fetches responses and updates `Quiz_Results`.
- `sendDailyResults()` ‚Üí Sends results via email.
- `markAbsentParticipants()` ‚Üí Marks absent users and notifies them.

## Error Handling & Debugging
- **Logging**: Uses `Logger.log()` to capture function execution details.
- **Try-Catch Blocks**: Wrapped around email sending and data processing to catch errors.
- **Manual Debugging**: Run individual functions via Apps Script editor to isolate issues.

## Future Improvements
- **Leaderboard Feature**: Display a leaderboard based on scores.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Create a web-based UI for managing quizzes.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Adapt the quiz for different languages.
